# **Welcome to the nsp13-models repo!**
This is a repository designed to host files relevant to designing a drug against the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, or "helicase" protein.
At the time of this writing, there is not a structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13. There is one, 6JYT, of SARS nsp13, but it is an apo structure and thus less useful for designing small molecule inhibitors.

## **Structures and models**
This includes these directories:
**deposited_structures**: a directory for structures fetched from the PDB, perhaps prepared in some way
**homology_models**: models of SARS-Cov-2 in various
**isolde_models**: these are models fetched from the <https://insidecorona.net> GitHub repo.

## **Modeling Tools**
**alignment_files**: contains Clustal files (*.aln) and simple fasta files which are used to build homology models

## **PyMol Visualization Tools**
**pymol_sessions**: pymol sessions which help to visualize what we are trying to accomplish
**pymol_scripts**: simple pymol scripts (.py and .pml) useful for this project
**movies_and_images**: movies and images made either from pymol sessions or illustrated
